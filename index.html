    <p>As this static, Web 1.0 nonsense clearly demonstrates, I am not a web developer.
    You should be happy there's even any CSS.  Here, though, are some
    things that I <i>am</i> interested in:</p>

    <p>I like taking pictures, but I don't feel like any strong philosophy guides
    my work.  I like using primes for the aperture, the image quality, and how
    consistent use helps you to start considering your framing before you even
    bring the viewfinder up.  Walk around with different primes and you
    <i>see</i> different things.  These days cell phones dominate my metadata.</p>
    <p>I like Nikon.  I like Lightroom.</p>

    <p>I've always liked computers.  When I was a kid I learned the basics of
    C, wrote stupid games for the TI-89, and spent a massive amount of time
    playing Mystical MUD.</p>
    <p>Most of my professional life has been spent developing C++ desktop
    applications, doing basic sysadmin work, and writing scripts to automate a
    variety of things.  Often I have some spare cycles for contract work in
    this area, so reach out if you're interested.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/xyshal">Here</a> is my Github.  There's not
    much on it, but my dotfiles are there to critique, and I recently wrote a
    Qt application designed to visualize and gather statistics about how many
    counties in the United States you've visited.</p>
    <p>Here are some of my firm philosophical positions, in no particular order:
    <ul>
      <li>Defining contracts.  The expectations of any piece of code should be
        able to be understood without comment.  Asserts.  Const correctness.
        These days, can this be constexpr?
      <li>Speaking of comments, I use them to break up functions into sections
        and to document things that should be changed.  Outside of this, only
        especially complicated logic should have comments -- strive to write
        code that is readable without comments.
      <li>Your commit log should explain why, not what.  I can look at the diff
        and see what the commit did.  I should be able to look at a comment
        explaining what a particularly complex bit of code does if I'm trying
        to understand the what.  I am looking back at the history of this
        function because I want to understand <b>why</b> some decision was
        made; what the intention of this API was, et cetera.
      <li>Clarity over brevity.  Only use auto for things like `auto* p = new
        LongClassName&lt;Template&gt;();`  Or the result of std::find.  Things
        like that.  Don't you dare `auto f = function_call();` me.  C++ is a
        strongly typed language for a reason.
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw0UBuTKHHg">west const</a>
        is the only acceptable choice.
      <li>Clarity over optimization.  Premature optimization yields unreadable
        (and thus unmaintainable) code.  Save structure packing,
        (non-automatic) cache optimization, and whatnot for code that actually
        needs to be fast.
      <li>With the above said, don't make ridiculous decisions.  Use
        std::unordered_map unless your map needs to always be sorted.
        Profile things as a matter of course -- if you're writing some class
        that is meant to support 1000 things...  profile how it behaves
        supporting 100,000 things.  Find your stupid mistakes.
      <li>Compile and run the tests with sanitizers.
      <li>Test-driven development isn't a necessity, but it's a good idea.
      <li>Outsource to third party libraries whenever possible.  The chances
        are quite low you are going to write a better library for some common
        protocol in which you are not an expert.  For C++, <a href="https://conan.io">conan</a>
        is great.  Keep those libraries up-to-date as a matter of course.
      <li>Aside from the perennial "what should this be named?" discussion,
        nothing spends more time than discussion during code reviews about code
        style.  Eliminate that time completely and enforce a clang-format file
        on your codebase.  It doesn't even matter what the format is, just pick
        something.  That way if you want to see it differently, have checkout
        and commit hooks that format it the way <i>you'd</i> like.
      <li>Stop doing things and running services as root.  It shocks me how
        often I still see people wrecking permissions and risking exploitation
        with this.
      <li>Standardize the build environment.  Docker, configuration management,
        anything you need to do so that there aren't errors that only happen on
        the build system.
      <li>Use <a href="https://www.vim.org">vim</a>.  Eight megabytes and
        constantly swapping!
    </ul>
    Here is a haiku I wrote that in no way reflects my perpetual experience
    with memory management:<br><br>
